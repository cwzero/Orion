Idea:
    - Facilitate non-linear, flexible play
    - Minimize GM prep work
    - Maximize dynamicity

Resolution Mechanic Target:
    - Transactional.  Players decide what they want to do, GM tells them what it will cost.
    - Cost of actions becomes a currency for the GM to act on
    - In-narrative way of codifying this?
    - "I want to do X." "X will cost Y." "Ok, I do it." then GM gets Y points to spend on bad stuff

Ability for magic to go wrong/fail?
More energy = more chance to go wrong
Bartering - GM and player have to agree on cost

Energy spent vs risk vs chance of failure
Higher chance of failure = lower risk, lower energy
Bigger spells = more energy, more discrete chances to fail
Cost = having to do tasks

Players do not die.  Rather, the risk is that you will be consumed by the magic, that you will default on a contract or that your debts will become too large.
Some magic will incur an energy debt, which needs to be rectified eventually.  Build up too large an energy debt and you will be reclaimed by some god or monster.
