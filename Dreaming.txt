- "The Dreaming"
    General name for both the magical act and the magical world we bridge to with it
- The dreaming isn't just a world of dreams.  It is a world where magic and myth are true, where monsters and gods dwell.  It's the void between worlds, the land of dreams, the 
    afterlife and the source of creativity and power.  The fact that magic comes from there prove that it is more than just the world of dreams.  It is also the connection between
    all other worlds.  While it seems like all magical things come from the dreaming, it's entirely possible that everything in the dreaming comes from the strange worlds it connects, 
    certainly many or most of them do.
- Name for protective layer (the veil - just the inner, mundane layer of the dreaming)
- Our world is surrounded by a protective barrier (the veil).  Inside of this barrier, we have our own slice of the dreaming known as the Aether or the Thorns.  The innermost edge of
    this is like our metaphysical atmosphere, the area we touch during mundane, everyday normal sleeping dreams.
- Some other worlds have protective barriers.  Each is different, and require a Path to get through.  Many of them have not been cracked, and the paths that have been cracked are
    closely guarded secrets.
- Dreams are in the outer layer of the outer layer, totally (relatively) mundane
- The dreaming is the empty space between worlds and the web that connects them

- The Dreaming is a land of smoke and mirrors, illusion.  Normal people visit while asleep, and its power washes over them without leaving any major traces behind, beyond the obvious.
- Mages also access the dreaming in order to do magic.  Entering the dreaming doesn't require that you leave the mundane world, though it does require that you travel through the veil.

- Manifestations
    - Objects, creatures from the dreaming
    - May be shaped by human minds, may be twisted and strange instead.
    - May be your dream or someone else's, maybe someone long dead
- Minds as portals to the dreaming, but more directly things like books, myths, etc
- Mundane people getting further in, getting lost
- Myths and legends, faerie courts as realms of the dreaming
- Dreaming is a shifting, changing place.  It has realms within it, but they are always moving and changing.  Its rules change all the time
    - Some areas of the dreaming imitate more real worlds, some might even be indistinguishable
- The Dreaming is generally navigated by the sets of rules it follows, which is what defines each area (areas defined by their rules)
- Some unstable areas may change before your eyes, some will take generations or eons.
- Within any area, the rules are generally pretty predictable/stable.
- Some areas are domains, which are controlled by some entity, and their stablity depends on that entity
- In the dreaming, physical appearance may be very important, or it may be fluid and meaningless.  It depends on where the power comes from
- Certain areas may be more or less stable than others
- It's possible for the areas of the dreaming or the dreaming itself to move, so you can change areas without moving yourself, or not change areas when you expect to
- Dreaming as a connection between all worlds, but it's impossible to tell where a world other than your own begins and the dreaming ends.  Other worlds might just be parts of the
     dreaming itself
- Certain areas of the dreaming are called dreams.
    - What are these areas and why are they different/called dreams?
- There are paths for traveling through the dreaming and returning to the world.  These are called dreamways.  The dreamer brings power with them when they return.
- There are factions and races which seem almost native to the dreaming
- The dreaming is always locally shaped by the willpower of its residents.

- Methodology for entering and traveling the dreaming
- Creating tethers to the real world, and ties to people places and objects within the dreaming (sources of magic)
- Manifestation of ideas, patterns and stories from the dreaming into the real world
- Things in the dreaming are real, they just follow different rules.
- Mages start by bringing objects out of dreams on accident, or by engaging in lucid dreaming in a specific way

- Places in the dreaming or paths within the dreaming (or objects, people) may be less concrete(more abstract) than real places, paths, objects or people, and manifestations may be
    abstract as well (spirits or patterns that aren't visible / affect an area or a group rather than being a physical thing that comes out, like curses etc)

- Power has an inverse relationship with sanity, as your ability to transcend the rules of reality lessens your ability to tie yourself to them
- Acting as a conduit for power for too long
- Get lost in the dreaming, get possessed
- Every world is a journey
- Every world is just a dream, but some last longer, some are more personal and shorter/less concrete

- You can enter the dreaming mentally, or leave it mentally.  This is projection, and has many limitations.
- You can physically enter the dreaming through a gateway, which is either a set physical gateway that doubles as a gateway to the dreaming under certain circumstances,
    or an abstract set of steps which can be performed at any physical gateway (door, arch, etc) provided the location and situation fits the criteria allowing the 
    steps to be performed (known as a path)
- Gateways don't have to resemble actual gateways, though most do
- Some paths are more dangerous than others.  Some have requirements which don't involve a real gateway.  Some are more twisted and different
- Different paths shape the magic of a mage.  They are closely guarded secrets
- Leaving the dreaming can sometimes be easier or harder than entering it
- Paths are the steps used to access the dreaming.  Not every path requires the dreamer actually enter the dreaming, some may summon power without that requirement.  These are typically
    more secret, more restricted and either less powerful or more specific.

- Themes for the dreaming: Magic, (Long, Unknown) History, Libraries, Mythology, Origin Stories, Shadow, Secrets, Mystery, Forbidden Knowledge
- The dreaming is a living place, and everything there is alive(though some things are just part of a larger living thing, depending on how separate they are from each other), 
    though not everything will show it.
- Therefore, anything magical is at least a little bit alive (or has been separated from a larger whole which is alive)
- The dreaming will exert pressure for magic to return, so it takes effort for magical stuff to stay in the mundane world
- Things taken from the dreaming might be pulled back after some time, or manifestations may trigger other manifestations to pull them back into the dreaming
- Some parts of the dreaming are more like just dreams (temporary) while other parts are more like actual worlds (more permanent)
- Sometimes the stuff that keeps the real world and the dreaming separate gets damaged and collapses, causing one to drift into the other
- Sometimes mundane people drift into the veil or further by accident, even when awake
- Manifestations which are destroyed return to the dreaming
- Manifestations may merge with mundane objects or places or people
- Objects which fit certain criteria may summon a manifestation which merges in and then summons other manifestations (archetypes)
- PCs must defend the things they are bonded to: the things that give them power
- Things in the dreaming may not be what they appear (same with manifestations)
- Things in the dreaming may suddenly shift (same with manifestations)
- Entire places may manifest, and gateways may form naturally (gateway manifestations)
- PCs are archetype gateways, conduits for certain things from the dreaming.  That is how magic works

- Everyone is connected to the dreaming, as we walk it in our sleep.  What the dreaming gives us when we walk it this way is an essential part of who we are
- In exchange, people push away things which come from the dreaming and appear in our world, when they are aware there is something wrong
- There's always a chance that subtle magic will get noticed at least a little
- People also project into the dreaming when they daydream or get lost in thought or space out
- Chaos occurs when people are truly confronted with manifestations and magic, people reject it and behave erratically
- This leads to rules against performing magic in view of mundanes
- People who have regular contact with magic lose magical stability
- Remembering what is real is hard when you have access to magic.  Some people will snap back to being a mundane and forget it, some will get lost in the dreaming

- There can be no real maps of the dreaming, due to its ever-shifting nature.  However, it has certain predictable features which create something resembling structure
- Things get weirder the further out you go, generally.  This idea doesn't always make sense, as the idea of physical distance and organized space doesn't always apply
- Due to the general progressive nature, you can get a general sense of how to find things, as certain places are relatively stable in how far out they are

- Players are voidwalkers, dreamers, travellers
- Sorcerers are typically people who use just the power of their divine spark to do magic.  Players are fully capable of this, but Dreaming is typically less restrictive and more useful.
    Technically the word is appropriate for anyone who does magic, but it's generally used for those who stick to soulfire magic.
- Mage is a general term for anyone who does magic.
- Players must form connections and bonds at each layer before they go deeper
- Going too deep too quickly gets you lost
- The deeper you go the more power you get
- Becoming a dreamer requires you be broken somehow, and repaired by something (living entity, things that might be called gods) in the dreaming
- The transformation of a broken person into a dreamer requires the infusion of a divine spark, a burning piece of a god
- Dreamers must maintain bonds(relationships) with the real world, with the being that gave them their spark, and with the sources of their magic
- Many monsters and gods were people once.  Even powers may have begun as dreamers who got greedy and sucked into something they valued.

- Human souls come from the dreaming, and return there after death.

- Access to magic is made by creating bonds or connections to entities native to the dreaming
- Contracts are agreements with entities which tie repeated access to some sort of magic power to following certain rules.
    - Contracts may be void if the rules are broken, or they may include rules about the consequences of breaking the rules
    - Almost all contracts involve behavioral rules as well as the completion of some kind of task tied to the usage of power
    - Sometimes you have to do the task before you use the power, sometimes after.  They are almost always one task to one usage.
- Pledges are less formal, typically verbal agreements and usually more temporary, though not necessarily less powerful (sometimes much more powerful than a typical contract)
- Orders are groups formed through a larger type of contract, which applies to each member of the order.

- In moments of desperation, dreamers may need access to power which doesn't correspond to an existing contract, or power that isn't currently available to them.
    - They can reach out and pull on the dreaming in order to summon the power they need.  These requests will be filled by Genies (djinn).
        - Genies grant favors in threes.  This is generally a hard rule, and the Genie will hang around until you make three requests.  You may or may not have to haggle over the price
            of each request separately.  It's generally not a good thing to have a Genie around.  The Genie gets to use you as a conduit to put its power into the world, and act for as
            long as it takes you to make the three requests. (Time is suspended for the actual requesting/haggling, and the Genie leaves as soon as the final request is made.)
        - Asking for a favor from a Genie usually involves haggling over the price, as well as how much risk you are willing to take as well as the chance of failure of the magic.
            (Genies are typically unwilling to go anywhere near 100% chance of getting what you want, they typically want some chance you will fail, and preferably some chance it will
                go horribly wrong)
        - Genies give you power now but you have to pay it back later.  There are several ways you might have to pay it back, at the whim of the Genie
            depending on the Genie and the situation.
                - Find a contract in the future which would have allowed you to accomplish the task, and have the entity trade for the debt as part of the contract 
                    (which will affect the terms of the deal)
                - Make a (potentially open-ended) Pledge to the Genie, typically involving some specific unusual and inscrutable task, or agree to do a task in the future
                    - Specifications for what tasks might involve need to be done now
                - Accumulate a roughly equal-value amount of Risk (see Risk system)
                - Allow an entity to act through you, or pursue a goal for the Genie by possessing someone else.
                - Accrue direct/pure energy debt.  This is the most common type of exchange and is almost always an option.  You must make an agreement with an entity (typically a power,
                    god, titan or gestalt) to accomplish some sort of task equivalent to the energy debt.  Failure to resolve debt or accumulating too much leads to you becoming a monster
        - Some genies will be more predictable, some less.  They are the origin of the idea of trickster gods, of mischevious spirits and prankster ghosts.
        - Players may deal with recurring Genies, but not always the same ones
        - Rather than directly fulfilling the request, Genies may connect a dreamer with an entity which wishes to make a contract, with additional costs added into the contract.
            - This is a separate case from the above, and happens instead of the normal haggling.  They will only haggle over the additional cost in the contract which goes to the Genie.

- The world is composed of the bones of titans, and the blood of gods.
- Gods are powered by soulfire.  Dreamers have a spark of soulfire, which they can channel for power, after which it takes time and rest to replenish.
- Gods are characters with personality, history, etc.
- Powers are the embodiment of a concept, etc.  They have personality, history etc. insofar as it relates to the concept they are a power of.
- The more people talk about, think about, conceptualize and mythologize a power the more it becomes a God
- Gestalt are like Gods, but rather than a singular entity they are a connected group which share an archetype and are mentally linked.  They may be a single entity with many bodies it
    uses like limbs(which would actually be more like a God pretending to be a Gestalt most of the time, unless the bodies are able to act and exist semi-independently), a hive mind, 
    a bureacracy, or anything in between.

- Gods and powers typically appear in the mundane world through messages/messengers, servants.
- The second most common appearance is through vessels/avatars, with direct possession of a mundane person or messenger/servant

- The Fae are a race which seem to be native to the Dreaming.
- Courts have strict rules and traditions, hierarchy
- Courts are headed by Fae nobles/royalty, which wield power willingly lent to them by those below them in the Court's hierarchy.

- Mage hunters are relatively mysterious beings who hunt those who break rules known only to the hunters.  Most dreamers who don't get especially greedy never even realize the
    Hunters are more than a myth.  Those who do find out they are real typically get dragged off to someplace no one has ever returned from (God knows where, in the colloquial).

- There is no formal training for Dreamers.  Dreamers are trained by a mentor, and sworn to secrecy on most of their training.  Some groups are more organized, orders even more so.
- Dreamers don't generally die.  They will instead either become lost in the dreaming, or get dragged off to become a monster or servant.  This usually happens when a player violates
    a contract, fails to uphold an agreement or accumulates too much energy debt.

- In certain situations, Dreamers may be cut off from their normal bonds, powers and paths.  They will have to seek out new bonds or paths, or reach out to other dreamers for help.
- Bonds may require that a dreamer forsake information or another bond.  Information can be wiped from their mind, or even forbidden for the future.
    - Some bonds cannot just be dropped or lightly broken.
        - Probably, most or all bonds cannot be lightly broken, all should have a cost.
- Sometimes contracts might be forged between two sets of humans, with power given by a patron of one or the other.  This allows for temporary access to information, for example.

- Some objects(Items) are manifestations, some are archetypes, some are bonded to things in the dreaming, some just have the ability to channel energy
