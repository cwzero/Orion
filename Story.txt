- "First People" came through a portal from a dying world, last act of desperation
- The beasts which devoured the old world would hunt us if they knew where we went.
    - This is the only thing about the old world which hasn't faded and twisted into myth
- Old world forgotten, generations ago
- People live in patched up ruined cities, which have sturdy highways between them.
- The world beyond the cities and the highways(and waterways, seas, oceans, rivers) is almost entirely unexplored, due to danger
- Jungles, Forests, Rainforests, Deserts.
- Multiple continents, sea travel is done regularly but pretty dangerous

- The party discovered that the first people fled this world
- We discovered the path to the world they fled to (also abandoned, different ruins, different treasure)
